## How can you run the project ?

You need to download node.js. Currently i am using version 12.18.4

After downloading node.js in the root first you need to run:

### `npm install`

to install all the packages.

After installing all the packages again in the project directory, you can run:

### `npx nodemon server.js`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.

## How can you play ?

When you open the http://localhost:3000 you need to see Create Game and Join Game buttons.

Enter a name and create game. After you created a game room you need to see a game code in the heading copy it.
Open [http://localhost:3000] in new browser tab or in new broser.
Again Enter a name and paste the game code in [Enter Game Code] input.
After all of this click join game in new opened browser tab.

So we created multiplayer with socket.io. Players can play in different browser.
